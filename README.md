# Simulating_Pool
This is my attempt at simulating a game of 'pool' ( generally speaking) using python. I am super happy on how it turned out.

# How to Use
So I won't make this super long or professional, simply have vscode or any other IDE and 
clone the file to your machine. Everything should be in place to work regarding the imports
and I will glady accept any improvments!
